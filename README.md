# 🌍 Climate Data Analysis: Temperature Trends Over Time

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical climate data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in temperature changes over time. By exploring average temperatures across various locations and dates, the goal is to gain meaningful insights into global climate behavior and detect any signals of climate change.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze average temperature variations over time.
- Explore how different regions experience temperature change.
- Identify seasonal trends and long-term climate patterns.
- Visualize data to make findings easy to interpret and actionable.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset includes:
- `Date`: Recorded date of temperature.
- `AverageTemperature`: Observed average temperature.
- `AverageTemperatureUncertainty`: Margin of error in the measurement.
- `Latitude` and `Longitude`: Geographic location.
- `City` and `Country`: Location information.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – Analysis environment

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- Line chart of average temperature over years (by city or globally)
- Heatmap of temperature correlations between locations
- Seasonal decomposition plots
- Geographic map visualizing temperature anomalies

## 📌 Insights & Findings
- Identified clear warming trends in most major cities.
- Noticed seasonal temperature cycles.
- Correlations between geographic latitude and average temperature.
- Possible signs of global warming observed through increasing annual averages.

## 🔄 Future Work
- Predict future temperatures using time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- Integrate other climate variables (CO₂ levels, precipitation).
- Build interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau.
